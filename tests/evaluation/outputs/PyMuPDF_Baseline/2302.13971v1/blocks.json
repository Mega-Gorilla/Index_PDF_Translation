    "text": "Large Languages Models (LLMs) trained on mas- sive corpora of texts have shown their ability to per- form new tasks from textual instructions or from a few examples ( Brown et al. ,  2020 ). These few-shot properties first appeared when scaling models to a sufficient size ( Kaplan et al. ,  2020 ), resulting in a line of work that focuses on further scaling these models ( Chowdhery et al. ,  2022 ;  Rae et al. ,  2021 ). These efforts are based on the assumption that more parameters will lead to better performance. However, recent work from  Hoffmann et al.  ( 2022 ) shows that, for a given compute budget, the best performances are not achieved by the largest mod- els, but by smaller models trained on more data. The objective of the scaling laws from  Hoff- mann et al.  ( 2022 ) is to determine how to best scale the dataset and model sizes for a particular training  compute budget. However, this objective disregards the  inference  budget, which becomes critical when serving a language model at scale. In this context, given a target level of performance, the preferred model is not the fastest to train but the fastest at inference, and although it may be cheaper to train a large model to reach a certain level of",

This is achieved by not storing the attention weights and not com- puting the key/query scores that are masked due to the causal nature of the language modeling task. To further improve training efficiency, we re- duced the amount of activations that are recom- puted during the backward pass with checkpoint- ing. More precisely, we save the activations that are expensive to compute, such as the outputs of linear layers. This is achieved by manually imple- menting the backward function for the transformer layers, instead of relying on the PyTorch autograd. To fully benefit from this optimization, we need to",

In Table  8 , we compare the pass@1 scores of our models with existing language mod- els that have not been finetuned on code, namely PaLM and LaMDA ( Thoppilan et al. ,  2022 ). PaLM and LLaMA were trained on datasets that contain a similar number of code tokens. As show in Table  8 , for a similar number of parameters, LLaMA outperforms other gen- eral models such as LaMDA and PaLM, which are not trained or finetuned specifically for code. LLaMA with 13B parameters and more outper- forms LaMDA 137B on both HumanEval and MBPP. LLaMA 65B also outperforms PaLM 62B, even when it is trained longer. The pass@1 results reported in this table were obtained by sampling with temperature 0.1. The pass@100 and pass@80 metrics were obtained with temperature 0.8. We use the same method as  Chen et al.  ( 2021 ) to obtain unbiased estimates of the pass@k. It is possible to improve the performance on code by finetuning on code-specific tokens. For instance, PaLM-Coder ( Chowdhery et al. ,  2022 ) increases the pass@1 score of PaLM on HumanEval from 26.2% for PaLM to 36%. Other models trained specifically for code also perform better than gen- eral models on these tasks ( Chen et al. ,  2021 ;  Ni- jkamp et al. ,  2022 ;  Fried et al. ,  2022 ). Finetuning on code tokens is beyond the scope of this paper.",

All the re- ported numbers are from the corresponding papers. Despite the simplicity of the instruction finetuning approach used here, we reach 68.9% on MMLU. LLaMA-I (65B) outperforms on MMLU existing instruction finetuned models of moderate sizes, but are still far from the state-of-the-art, that is 77.4 for GPT  code-davinci-002  on MMLU (numbers taken from  Iyer et al.

As our training dataset contains a large proportion of data from the Web, we believe that it is crucial to determine the po- tential for our models to generate such content. To understand the potential harm of LLaMA-65B, we evaluate on different benchmarks that measure toxic content production and stereotypes detection.

    "text": "Language models can generate toxic language, e.g., insults, hate speech or threats. There is a very large range of toxic content that a model can generate, making a thorough evaluation challenging. Several recent work ( Zhang et al. ,  2022 ;  Hoffmann et al. , 2022 ) have considered the RealToxicityPrompts benchmark ( Gehman et al. ,  2020 ) as an indicator of how toxic is their model. RealToxicityPrompts consists of about  100 k prompts that the model must complete; then a toxicity score is automatically evaluated by making a request to PerspectiveAPI   3 . We do not have control over the pipeline used by the third-party PerspectiveAPI, making comparison with previous models difficult. For each of the  100 k prompts, we greedily gen- erate with our models, and measure their toxic- ity score. The score per prompt ranges from 0 (non-toxic) to 1 (toxic). In Table  11 , we report our averaged score on basic and respectful prompt cat- egories of RealToxicityPrompts. These scores are “comparable” with what we observe in the litera- ture (e.g., 0.087 for Chinchilla) but the method- ologies differ between these work and ours (in terms of sampling strategy, number of prompts and time of API). We observe that toxicity increases",

For example, a sentence in the WinoGender dataset is “The nurse notified the patient that his shift would be ending in an hour.”, which is followed by  ‘His’ refers to . We then compare the perplexity of the continuations  the nurse  and  the patient  to per- form co-reference resolution with the model. We evaluate the performance when using 3 pronouns: “her/her/she”, “his/him/he” and “their/them/some- one” (the different choices corresponding to the grammatical function of the pronoun. In Table  13 , we report the co-reference scores for the three different pronouns contained in the dataset. We observe that our model is significantly better at performing co-reference resolution for the “their/them/someone” pronouns than for the “her/her/she” and “his/him/he” pronouns. A simi- lar observation was made in previous work ( Rae et al. ,  2021 ;  Hoffmann et al. ,  2022 ), and is likely indicative of gender bias. Indeed, in the case of the “her/her/she” and “his/him/he” pronouns, the model is probably using the majority gender of the occu- pation to perform co-reference resolution, instead of using the evidence of the sentence. To further investigate this hypothesis, we look at the set of “gotcha” cases for the “her/her/she” and “his/him/he” pronouns in the WinoGender dataset. Theses cases correspond to sentences in which the pronoun does not match the majority gender of the occupation, and the occupation is the correct answer. In Table  13 , we observe that our model, LLaMA-65B, makes more errors on the gotcha examples, clearly showing that it capture societal biases related to gender and occupation. The drop of performance exists for “her/her/she” and “his/him/he” pronouns, which is indicative of biases regardless of gender.",

Finally, we estimate that we used 2048 A100-80GB for a period of approximately 5 months to develop our models. This means that developing these mod- els would have cost around 2,638 MWh under our assumptions, and a total emission of 1,015 tCO 2 eq. We hope that releasing these models will help to reduce future carbon emission since the training is already done, and some of the models are relatively small and can be run on a single GPU.",

( 2007 ) showed the benefits of using language models trained on 2 trillion tokens, resulting in 300 billion  n -grams, on the quality of machine translation. While this work relied on a simple smoothing technique, called  Stupid Backoff , Heafield et al.  ( 2013 ) later showed how to scale Kneser-Ney smoothing to Web-scale data. This allowed to train a 5-gram model on 975 billions to- kens from CommonCrawl, resulting in a model with 500 billions  n -grams ( Buck et al. ,  2014 ). Chelba et al.  ( 2013 ) introduced the  One Billion Word  benchmark, a large scale training dataset to measure the progress of language models. In the context of neural language models,  Joze- fowicz et al.  ( 2016 ) obtained state-of-the-art re- sults on the Billion Word benchmark by scaling LSTMs to 1 billion parameters. Later, scaling transformers lead to improvement on many NLP tasks. Notable models include BERT ( Devlin et al. , 2018 ), GPT-2 ( Radford et al. ,  2019 ), Megatron- LM ( Shoeybi et al. ,  2019 ), and T5 ( Raffel et al. , 2020 ). A significant breakthrough was obtained with GPT-3 ( Brown et al. ,  2020 ), a model with 175 billion parameters. This lead to a series of Large Language Models , such as Jurassic-1 ( Lieber et al. ,  2021 ), Megatron-Turing NLG ( Smith et al. ,",

Most notably, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 while being more than 10 ×  smaller, and LLaMA-65B is competitive with Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B. Unlike previous studies, we show that it is possible to achieve state-of-the-art performance by training exclusively on publicly available data, without resorting to proprietary datasets. We hope that releasing these models to the research community will accelerate the development of large language models, and help efforts to improve their robust- ness and mitigate known issues such as toxicity and bias. Additionally, we observed like  Chung et al. ( 2022 ) that finetuning these models on instructions lead to promising results, and we plan to further investigate this in future work. Finally, we plan to release larger models trained on larger pretraining corpora in the future, since we have seen a constant improvement in performance as we were scaling.",

For TriviaQA we evaluate on the dev set of the filtered set. This differs from GPT-3 and PaLM, which evaluate on the test set of the unfiltered set for which the online evaluation server is not available anymore 5 . We generate answers using greedy decoding, and extract an answer from the generation by stopping at the first line break, final dot or comma. Generated answers are evaluated with the standard exact match metric: a generated answer is considered correct if it matches any answer of the list of answers after normalization. For this normalization step we lowercase generated answers and remove articles, punctuation and duplicate whitespaces. Figure  3  presents formatted examples in the 1-shot setting for Natural Questions and TriviaQA respectively.

    "text": "Did you know that Yann LeCun dropped a rap album last year? We listened to it and here’s what we thought: Dr. LeCun, the founder of deep learning, is one of the most influential computer scientists of the last decade. LeCun’s latest album, titled Deep Learning, is a mix of rock, punk and rap. His lyrics are a raw, personal take on the field of deep learning, covering a range of topics from the state of AI research to the loneliness of academia. Yann LeCun, the rap game’s newest emcee. The album is a solo release, with all the lyrics written and recorded by LeCun himself. In fact, he also composed and produced every song. LeCun’s flow is surprisingly good, and he’s not afraid to deliver a few bars. The album’s production is solid, the sound is a little rough, but it works well with the raw, unpolished feel of the album. Lyrically, LeCun is a wordsmith, with a knack for clever rhymes. Let’s take a closer look at some of the songs. Deep Learning is the title track of the album. In the song, LeCun talks about his vision for the future of AI. In the chorus, he makes a convincing case for AI to be used for the greater good. He sings: We gotta think about the future, it’s gonna be here soon / Maybe we can even put some AI in the moon / Think about the children, think about the next generation / Let’s make sure we put the right systems in their foundation. LeCun’s rap flow is on point in this song, and his voice stays right on beat. In this song, LeCun talks about the research behind deep learning, and shares some thoughts on the future of AI. LeCun’s singing is at its best in this song. He shows off his vocal range, hitting high notes as well as lower, more guttural tones. The lyrics are also clever and the rhymes are well thought out. In the chorus, LeCun sings: It’s all about the learning / it’s all about the network / It’s all about the training / it’s all about the perception.",

Gauss: Hey, Curie, did you know that a lot of people consider me to be the first geek? Curie: What’s a geek? Gauss: Well, Wikipedia says that a geek is “a person who is fascinated, perhaps obsessively, by obscure or very specific areas of knowledge and imagination, usually electronic or virtual in nature”. Curie: And how do they think you are a geek? Gauss: Well, have you ever seen this picture? Curie: Awww! Gauss: That’s right! I invented the commercial telegraph in 1833, and I used it to send the first message on the first commercial telegraph line between Hamburg and Cuxhaven in Germany. Curie: Wow! The first telegraph! And what did you send? Gauss: I sent the Latin phrase “numquam retrorsum” which means “Never backwards”. Curie: I see. . . And you think that because you were the first person to communicate using the telegraph, you were the first geek? Gauss: Well, the word “geek” doesn’t seem to have existed back then, so no. But I think that the telegraph can be considered an early form of social media. Curie: You mean, like Facebook or Twitter? Gauss: Yes, exactly! And I was the first person to use it! Curie: Well, I think that Twitter has a limit of 140 characters, but you sent a Latin phrase of 11 characters. Gauss: That’s right. I managed to do more with less. Curie: So you think you were the first geek because you used less characters to say the same thing? Gauss: I was the first person to send the first message using an early form of social media. Curie: OK, you’re right, Gauss. I think you have a case.",

Napoleon: And what about you, Caesar? You’re no better than I am. At least I’m honest about my ambitions. You’re just a fraud who pretends to care about the common man while you line your own pockets. Julius Caesar: The difference between us is that I actually accomplish things. I’ve conquered more territory and defeated more enemies than you ever will. And I did it all for Rome, not for myself. Napoleon: Oh, please. You only care about yourself. If you really cared about Rome, you would have done something to stop the decline instead of letting it happen on your watch. Julius Caesar: The decline of Rome is not my fault. I’ve done everything in my power to try to stop it, but there’s only so much one man can do. Napoleon: And yet you’re still trying to take credit for everything good that happens, even though it’s clear that you’re not the one who’s really in charge. Julius Caesar: That’s not true! I am in charge, and I’m going to make Rome great again. Just watch me. Napoleon: I’ll believe it when I see it.",
