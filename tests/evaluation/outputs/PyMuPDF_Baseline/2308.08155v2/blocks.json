AutoGen  agents are customizable,  conversable , and can operate in vari- ous modes that employ combinations of LLMs, human inputs, and tools. Using AutoGen , developers can also flexibly define agent interaction behaviors. Both natural language and computer code can be used to program flexible conversation patterns for different applications.  AutoGen  serves as a generic framework for building diverse applications of various complexities and LLM capacities. Em- pirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in many example applications, with domains ranging from mathematics, coding, question answer- ing, operations research, online decision-making, entertainment, etc.",

    "text": "Large language models (LLMs) are becoming a crucial building block in developing powerful  agents that utilize LLMs for reasoning, tool usage, and adapting to new observations (Yao et al., 2022; Xi et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b) in many real-world tasks. Given the expanding tasks that could benefit from LLMs and the growing task complexity, an intuitive approach to scale up the power of agents is to use multiple agents that cooperate. Prior work suggests that multiple agents can help encourage divergent thinking (Liang et al., 2023), improve factuality and reasoning (Du et al., 2023), and provide validation (Wu et al., 2023). In light of the intuition and early evidence of promise, it is intriguing to ask the following question:  how  can we facilitate the development of LLM applications that could span a broad spectrum of domains and complexities based on the multi-agent approach?",

    "text": "Our insight is to use  multi-agent conversations  to achieve it. There are at least three reasons con- firming its general feasibility and utility thanks to recent advances in LLMs: First, because chat- optimized LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) show the ability to incorporate feedback, LLM agents can cooperate through  conversations  with each other or human(s), e.g., a dialog where agents provide and seek rea- soning, observations, critiques, and validation. Second, because a single LLM can exhibit a broad range of capabilities (especially when configured with the correct prompt and inference settings), conversations between differently configured agents can help combine these broad LLM capabilities in a modular and complementary manner. Third, LLMs have demonstrated ability to solve complex tasks when the tasks are broken into simpler subtasks. Multi-agent conversations can enable this partitioning and integration in an intuitive manner. How can we leverage the above insights and support different applications with the common requirement of coordinating multiple agents, poten- tially backed by LLMs, humans, or tools exhibiting different capacities? We desire a multi-agent conversation framework with generic abstraction and effective implementation that has the flexibil- ity to satisfy different application needs. Achieving this requires addressing two critical questions: (1) How can we design individual agents that are capable, reusable, customizable, and effective in multi-agent collaboration? (2) How can we develop a straightforward, unified interface that can accommodate a wide range of agent conversation patterns? In practice, applications of varying complexities may need distinct sets of agents with specific capabilities, and may require different conversation patterns, such as single- or multi-turn dialogs, different human involvement modes, and static vs. dynamic conversation. Moreover, developers may prefer the flexibility to program agent interactions in natural language or code. Failing to adequately address these two questions would limit the framework’s scope of applicability and generality.",

    "text": "1  Customizable and conversable agents.  AutoGen  uses a generic design of agents that can lever- age LLMs, human inputs, tools, or a combination of them. The result is that developers can easily and quickly create agents with different roles (e.g., agents to write code, execute code, wire in human feedback, validate outputs, etc.) by selecting and configuring a subset of built-in capabilities. The agent’s backend can also be readily extended to allow more custom behaviors. To make these agents suitable for multi-agent conversation, every agent is made  conversable  – they can receive, react, and respond to messages. When configured properly, an agent can hold multiple turns of conversations with other agents autonomously or solicit human inputs at cer- tain rounds, enabling human agency and automation. The conversable agent design leverages the strong capability of the most advanced LLMs in taking feedback and making progress via chat and also allows combining capabilities of LLMs in a modular fashion. (Section 2.1) 2  Conversation programming.  A fundamental insight of  AutoGen  is to simplify and unify com- plex LLM application workflows as multi-agent conversations. So  AutoGen  adopts a program- ming paradigm centered around these inter-agent conversations. We refer to this paradigm as conversation programming , which streamlines the development of intricate applications via two primary steps: (1) defining a set of conversable agents with specific capabilities and roles (as described above); (2) programming the interaction behavior between agents via conversation- centric  computation  and  control . Both steps can be achieved via a fusion of natural and pro- gramming languages to build applications with a wide range of conversation patterns and agent behaviors.  AutoGen  provides ready-to-use implementations and also allows easy extension and experimentation for both steps. (Section 2.2)",

Since an agent’s capabilities directly influence how it processes and responds to messages,  AutoGen  allows flexibility to endow its agents with various capabilities.  AutoGen  supports many common composable capabilities for agents, including  1) LLMs.  LLM-backed agents exploit many capabilities of advanced LLMs such as role playing, implicit state inference and progress making conditioned on conversation history, providing feedback, adapting from feedback, and coding. These capabilities can be combined in different ways via novel prompting techniques 4   to increase an agent’s skill and autonomy.  AutoGen  also offers enhanced LLM inference features such as result caching, error handling, message templating, etc., via an enhanced LLM inference layer.  2) Humans.  Human involvement is desired or even essential in many LLM applications.  AutoGen  lets a human participate in agent conversation via human- backed agents, which could solicit human inputs at certain rounds of a conversation depending on the agent configuration. The default  user proxy  agent allows  configurable  human involvement levels and patterns, e.g., frequency and conditions for requesting human input including the option for humans to skip providing input.  3) Tools.  Tool-backed agents have the capability to execute tools via code execution or function execution. For example, the default user proxy agent in  AutoGen  is able to execute code suggested by LLMs, or make LLM-suggested function calls.",

And the second is  control flow  – the sequence (or conditions) un- der which these computations happen. As we will show in the applications section, the ability to program these helps implement many flexible multi-agent conversation patterns. In  AutoGen , these computations are conversation-centric. An agent takes actions relevant to the conversations it is involved in and its actions result in message passing for consequent conversations (unless a termina- tion condition is satisfied). Similarly, control flow is conversation-driven – the participating agents’ decisions on which agents to send messages to and the procedure of computation are functions of the inter-agent conversation. This paradigm helps one to reason intuitively about a complex workflow as agent action taking and conversation message-passing between agents.",

    "text": "1.  Unified interfaces and auto-reply mechanisms for automated agent chat. Agents in AutoGen  have unified conversation interfaces for performing the corresponding conversation- centric computation, including a  send/receive  function for sending/receiving messages and a generate reply  function for taking actions and generating a response based on the received message.  AutoGen  also introduces and by default adopts an  agent auto-reply  mechanism to realize conversation-driven control: Once an agent receives a message from another agent, it au- tomatically invokes  generate reply  and sends the reply back to the sender unless a termination condition is satisfied.  AutoGen  provides built-in reply functions based on LLM inference, code or function execution, or human input. One can also register custom reply functions to customize the behavior pattern of an agent, e.g., chatting with another agent before replying to the sender agent. Under this mechanism, once the reply functions are registered, and the conversation is initialized, the conversation flow is naturally induced, and thus the agent conversation proceeds naturally without any extra control plane, i.e., a special module that controls the conversation flow. For example, with the developer code in the blue-shaded area (marked “Developer Code”) of Figure 2, one can readily trigger the conversation among the agents, and the conversation would proceed automatically, as shown in the dialog box in the grey shaded area (marked “Pro- gram Execution”) of Figure 2. The auto-reply mechanism provides a decentralized, modular, and unified way to define the workflow. 2.  Control by fusion of programming and natural language.  AutoGen  allows the usage of programming and natural language in various control flow management patterns: 1)  Natural- language control via LLMs.  In  AutoGen , one can control the conversation flow by prompting the LLM-backed agents with natural language. For instance, the default system message of the built-in  AssistantAgent  in  AutoGen  uses natural language to instruct the agent to fix errors and generate code again if the previous result indicates there are errors. It also guides the agent to confine the LLM output to certain structures, making it easier for other tool-backed agents to consume. For example, instructing the agent to reply with “TERMINATE” when all tasks are completed to terminate the program. More concrete examples of natural language controls can be found in Appendix C. 2)  Programming-language control.  In  AutoGen , Python code can be used to specify the termination condition, human input mode, and tool execution logic, e.g., the max number of auto replies. One can also register programmed auto-reply functions to control the conversation flow with Python code, as shown in the code block identified as “Conversation- Driven Control Flow” in Figure 2. 3)  Control transition between natural and programming language.  AutoGen  also supports flexible control transition between natural and programming language. One can achieve transition from code to natural-language control by invoking an LLM inference containing certain control logic in a customized reply function; or transition from nat- ural language to code control via LLM-proposed function calls (Eleti et al., 2023).",

    "text": "In the conversation programming paradigm, one can realize multi-agent conversations of diverse patterns. In addition to static conversation with predefined flow,  AutoGen  also supports dynamic conversation flows with multiple agents.  AutoGen  provides two general ways to achieve this: 1) Customized  generate reply  function: within the customized  generate reply  function, one agent can hold the current conversation while invoking conversations with other agents depending on the content of the current message and context. 2) Function calls: In this approach, LLM decides whether or not to call a particular function depending on the conversation status. By messaging additional agents in the called functions, the LLM can drive dynamic multi-agent conversation. In addition,  AutoGen  supports more complex dynamic group chat via built-in  GroupChatManager , which can dynamically select the next speaker and then broadcast its response to other agents. We elaborate on this feature and its application in Section 3. We provide implemented working systems to showcase all these different patterns, with some of them visualized in Figure 3.",

We evaluate our system and several alternative approaches, including open-source methods such as Multi-Agent Debate (Liang et al., 2023), LangChain Re- Act (LangChain, 2023), vanilla GPT-4, and commercial products ChatGPT + Code Interpreter, and ChatGPT + Plugin (Wolfram Alpha), on the MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) dataset and summarize the results in Figure 4a. We perform evaluations over 120 randomly selected level-5 problems and on the entire 5   test dataset from MATH. The results show that the built-in agents from  AutoGen  al- ready yield better performance out of the box compared to the alternative approaches, even including the commercial ones. ( Scenario 2 ) We also showcase a human-in-the-loop problem-solving process with the help of  AutoGen . To incorporate human feedback with  AutoGen , one only needs to set human input mode=‘ALWAYS’  in the  UserProxyAgent  of the system in scenario 1. We demon- strate that this system can effectively incorporate human inputs to solve challenging problems that cannot be solved without humans. ( Scenario 3 ) We further demonstrate a novel scenario where multiple  human users can participate in the conversations during the problem-solving process. Our experiments and case studies for these scenarios show that AutoGen enables better performance or new experience compared to other solutions we experimented with. Due to the page limit, details of the evaluation, including case studies in three scenarios are in Appendix D.",

In this evaluation, we compare our system with DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval) following an existing evaluation 6   prac- tice (Adlakha et al., 2023). Leveraging the conversational design and natural-language control, AutoGen  introduces a novel  interactive retrieval  feature in this application: whenever the retrieved context does not contain the information, instead of terminating, the LLM-based assistant would reply “ Sorry, I cannot find any information about... UPDATE CONTEXT. ” which will invoke more retrieval attempts. We conduct an ablation study in which we prompt the assistant agent to say  “I don’t know”  instead of  “UPDATE CONTEXT.”  in cases where relevant information is not found, and report results in Figure 4b. The results show that the interactive retrieval mechanism indeed plays a non-trivial role in the process. We give a concrete example and results using this appealing feature in Appendix D.

    "text": "With  AutoGen , we implemented a two-agent system to solve tasks from ALFWorld. It consists of an LLM-backed assistant agent responsible for suggesting plans to conduct a task and an executor agent responsible for executing actions in the ALFWorld environments. This system integrates Re- Act prompting (Yao et al., 2022), and is able to achieve similar performance. A common challenge encountered in both ReAct and the  AutoGen -based two-agent system is their occasional inability to leverage basic commonsense knowledge about the physical world. This deficiency can lead to the system getting stuck in a loop due to repetitive errors. Fortunately, the modular design of  AutoGen allows us to address this issue effectively: With  AutoGen , we are able to introduce a grounding agent, which supplies crucial commonsense knowledge–such as  “You must find and take the object before you can examine it. You must go to where the target object is before you can use it.” –whenever the system exhibits early signs of recurring errors. It significantly enhances the system’s ability to avoid getting entangled in error loops. We compare the task-solving performance of the two variants of our system with GPT-3.5-turbo and ReAct 7   on the 134 unseen tasks from ALFWorld and report results in Figure 4c. The results show that introducing a grounding agent could bring in a 15% performance gain on average. Upon examining the systems’ outputs, we observe that the grounding agent, by delivering background commonsense knowledge at the right junctures, significantly miti- gated the tendency of the system to persist with a flawed plan, thereby avoiding the creation of error loops. For an example trajectory comparing the systems see Appendix D, Figure 10.",

The second sub-figure of Figure 3 shows the AutoGen -based implementation. The workflow is as follows: the end user sends questions, such as “ What if we prohibit shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2? ” to the Commander agent. The Com- mander coordinates with two assistant agents, including the Writer and the Safeguard, to answer the question. The Writer will craft code and send the code to the Commander. After receiving the code, the Commander checks the code safety with the Safeguard; if cleared, the Commander will use external tools (e.g., Python) to execute the code, and request the Writer to interpret the execution results. For instance, the writer may say “ if we prohibit shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2, the total cost would increase by 10.5%. ” The Commander then provides this concluding answer to the end user. If, at a particular step, there is an exception, e.g., security red flag raised by Safeguard, the Commander redirects the issue back to the Writer with debugging information. The process might be repeated multiple times until the user’s question is answered or timed-out.",

These make dynamic group chat ideal for situations where col- laboration without strict communication order is beneficial. In  AutoGen , the  GroupChatManager class serves as the conductor of conversation among agents and repeats the following three steps: dynamically selecting a speaker, collecting responses from the selected speaker, and broadcasting the message (Figure 3-A5). For the dynamic speaker-selection component, we use a role-play style prompt. Through a pilot study on 12 manually crafted complex tasks, we observed that compared to a prompt that is purely based on the task, utilizing a role-play prompt often leads to more effec- tive consideration of both conversation context and role alignment during the problem-solving and speaker-selection process. Consequently, this leads to a higher success rate and fewer LLM calls. We include detailed results in Appendix D.",

An illustrative example of these entertaining game dy- namics can be found in Figure 15, Appendix D. (2) Grounding, which is a crucial aspect to maintain game integrity. During gameplay, the board agent checks each proposed move for legality; if a move is invalid, the agent responds with an error, prompting the player agent to re-propose a legal move before continuing. This process ensures that only valid moves are played and helps maintain a con- sistent gaming experience. As an ablation study, we removed the board agent and instead only relied on a relevant prompt  “you should make sure both you and the opponent are making legal moves”  to ground their move. The results highlighted that without the board agent, illegitimate moves caused game disruptions. The modular design offered flexibility, allowing swift adjustments to the board agent in response to evolving game rules or varying chess rule variants.

    "text": "• Privacy and Data Protection: The framework allows for human participation in conversations between agents. It is important to ensure that user data and conversations are protected, and that developers use appropriate measures to safeguard privacy. • Bias and Fairness: LLMs have been shown to exhibit biases present in their training data (Navigli et al., 2023). When using LLMs in the  AutoGen  framework, it is crucial to address and mitigate any biases that may arise in the conversations between agents. Developers should be aware of potential biases and take steps to ensure fairness and inclusivity. • Accountability and Transparency: As discussed in the future work section, as the framework in- volves multiple agents conversing and cooperating, it is important to establish clear accountability and transparency mechanisms. Users should be able to understand and trace the decision-making process of the agents involved in order to ensure accountability and address any potential issues or biases. • Trust and Reliance:  AutoGen  leverages human understanding and intelligence while providing automation through conversations between agents. It is important to consider the impact of this interaction on user experience, trust, and reliance on AI systems. Clear communication and user education about the capabilities and limitations of the system will be essential (Cai et al., 2019). • Unintended Consequences: As discussed before, the use of multi-agent conversations and automa- tion in complex tasks may have unintended consequences. In particular, allowing LLM agents to make changes in external environments through code execution or function calls, such as installing packages, could be risky. Developers should carefully consider the potential risks and ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to prevent harm or negative outcomes.",

    "text": "•  AutoGPT : AutoGPT is an open-source implementation of an AI agent that attempts to au- tonomously achieve a given goal (AutoGPT, 2023). It follows a single-agent paradigm in which it augments the AI model with many useful tools, and does not support multi-agent collaboration. •  ChatGPT+ (with code interpreter or plugin) : ChatGPT, a conversational AI service or agent, can now be used alongside a code interpreter or plugin (currently available only under the pre- mium subscription plan ChatGPT Plus) (OpenAI, 2023). The code interpreter enables ChatGPT to execute code, while the plugin enhances ChatGPT with a wide range of curated tools. •  LangChain Agents : LangChain is a general framework for developing LLM-based applica- tions (LangChain, 2023). LangChain Agents is a subpackage for using an LLM to choose a sequence of actions. There are various types of agents in LangChain Agents, with the ReAct agent being a notable example that combines reasoning and acting when using LLMs (mainly designed for LLMs prior to ChatGPT) (Yao et al., 2022). All agents provided in LangChain Agents fol- low a single-agent paradigm and are not inherently designed for communicative and collaborative modes. A significant summary of its limitations can be found in (Woolf, 2023). Due to these lim- itations, even the multi-agent systems in LangChain (e.g., re-implementation of CAMEL) are not based on LangChain Agents but are implemented from scratch. Their connection to LangChain lies in the use of basic orchestration modules provided by LangChain, such as AI models wrapped by LangChain and the corresponding interface. •  Transformers Agent : Transformers Agent (HuggingFace, 2023) is an experimental natural- language API built on the transformers repository. It includes a set of curated tools and an agent to interpret natural language and use these tools. Similar to AutoGPT, it follows a single-agent paradigm and does not support agent collaboration.",

    "text": "•  BabyAGI : BabyAGI (BabyAGI, 2023) is an example implementation of an AI-powered task man- agement system in a Python script. In this implemented system, multiple LLM-based agents are used. For example, there is an agent for creating new tasks based on the objective and the result of the previous task, an agent for prioritizing the task list, and an agent for completing tasks/sub-tasks. As a multi-agent system, BabyAGI adopts a static agent conversation pattern, i.e., a predefined order of agent communication, while  AutoGen  supports both static and dynamic conversation patterns and additionally supports tool usage and human involvement. •  CAMEL : CAMEL (Li et al., 2023b) is a communicative agent framework. It demonstrates how role playing can be used to let chat agents communicate with each other for task comple- tion. It also records agent conversations for behavior analysis and capability understanding. An Inception-prompting technique is used to achieve autonomous cooperation between agents. Un- like  AutoGen , CAMEL does not natively support tool usage, such as code execution. Although it is proposed as an infrastructure for multi-agent conversation, it only supports static conversation patterns, while  AutoGen  additionally supports dynamic conversation patterns. •  Multi-Agent Debate:  Two recent works investigate and show that multi-agent debate is an effec- tive way to encourage divergent thinking in LLMs (Liang et al., 2023) and to improve the factuality and reasoning of LLMs (Du et al., 2023). In both works, multiple LLM inference instances are constructed as multiple agents to solve problems with agent debate. Each agent is simply an LLM inference instance, while no tool or human is involved, and the inter-agent conversation needs to follow a pre-defined order. These works attempt to build LLM applications with multi-agent conversation, while  AutoGen , designed as a generic infrastructure, can be used to facilitate this development and enable more applications with dynamic conversation patterns.",

With  AutoGen , humans can seamlessly and optionally cooperate with AIs to solve problems or generally participate in the activity.  AutoGen  also facilitates inter- active user instructions to ensure the process stays on the desired path.

For example,  AssistantAgent  is pre-configured to be backed by GPT-4, with a carefully designed system message for generic problem-solving via code. The  UserProxyAgent  is configured to solicit human inputs and perform tool execution. Many problems can be solved by simply combining these two agents. When customizing agents for an application, consider the following options: (1) human input mode, termination condition, code execution configuration, and LLM configuration can be specified when constructing an agent; (2)  AutoGen  supports adding instructions in an initial user message, which is an effective way to boost performance without needing to modify the system message; (3)  UserProxyAgent can be extended to handle different execution environments and exceptions, etc.; (4) when sys- tem message modification is needed, consider leveraging the LLM’s capability to program its conversation flow with natural language. 2.  Start with a simple conversation topology . Consider using the two-agent chat or the group chat setup first, as they can often be extended with the least code. Note that the two-agent chat can be easily extended to involve more than two agents by using LLM-consumable functions in a dynamic way. 3. Try to  reuse built-in reply methods  based on LLM, tool, or human before implementing a custom reply method because they can often be reused to achieve the goal in a simple way (e.g., the built-in agent  GroupChatManager ’s reply method reuses the built-in LLM-based reply function when selecting the next speaker, ref. A5 in Section 3). 4. When developing a new application with  UserProxyAgent ,  start with humans always in the loop , i.e., human input mode=‘ALWAYS’, even if the target operation mode is more au- tonomous. This helps evaluate the effectiveness of  AssistantAgent , tuning the prompt, dis- covering corner cases, and debugging. Once confident with small-scale success, consider setting",

Despite the numerous advantages of  AutoGen  agents, there could be cases/scenarios where  other libraries/packages could help . For example: (1) For (sub)tasks that do not have requirements for back-and-forth trouble-shooting, multi-agent interaction, etc., a unidirectional (no back-and- forth message exchange) pipeline can also be orchestrated with LangChain (LangChain, 2023), LlamaIndex (Liu, 2022), Guidance (Guidance, 2023), Semantic Kernel (Semantic-Kernel, 2023), Gorilla (Patil et al., 2023) or low-level inference API (‘autogen.oai’ provides an enhanced LLM inference layer at this level) (Dibia, 2023). (2) When existing tools from LangChain etc. are helpful, one can use them as tool backends for  AutoGen  agents. For example, one can readily use tools, e.g., Wolfram Alpha, from LangChain in  AutoGen  agent. (3) For specific applications, one may want to leverage agents implemented in other libraries/packages. To achieve this, one could wrap those agents as conversable agents in  AutoGen  and then use them to build LLM applications through multi-agent conversation. (4) It can be hard to find an optimal operating point among many tunable choices, such as the LLM inference configuration.

This failure shows that LLMs and multi-agent conversations with simple role playing are insufficient, and highly capable agents with diverse skill sets are essential.

This approach tries to exploit the capability of LLMs in implicit state inference to a large degree. LLMs do not follow all the instructions perfectly, so the design of the system needs to have other mechanisms to handle the exceptions and faults. Some instructions can have ambiguities, and the designer should either reduce them for preciseness or intentionally keep them for flexibility and address the different situations in other agents. In general, we observe that GPT-4 follows the instructions better than GPT-3.5-turbo.",

The qual- itative evaluations elucidate common failure reasons across several alternative approaches. Chat- GPT+Code Interpreter fails to solve the second problem, and ChatGPT+Plugin struggles to solve both problems. AutoGPT fails on both problems due to code execution issues. The LangChain agent also fails on both problems, producing code that results in incorrect answers in all trials. • Based on the qualitative evaluation, we analyze the user experience concerning the verbosity of the response and the ability of the LLM-based system to run without unexpected behaviors. Chat- GPT+Plugin is the least verbose, mainly because Wolfram queries are much shorter than Python code.  AutoGen , ChatGPT+Code Interpreter, and LangChain exhibit similar verbosity, although LangChain is slightly more verbose due to more code execution errors. AutoGPT is the most verbose system owing to predefined steps like THOUGHTS, REASONING, and PLAN, which it includes in replies every time. Overall,  AutoGen  and ChatGPT+Code Interpreter operate smoothly without exceptions. We note the occurrences of undesired behaviors from other LLM-based sys- tems that could affect user experience: AutoGPT consistently outputs code without the print’ statement and cannot correct this, requiring the user to run them manually; ChatGPT with Wol- fram Alpha plugin has the potential to become stuck in a loop that must be manually stopped; and Langchain ReAct could exit with a parse error, necessitating the passing of a ‘handle parse error’ parameter.",

    "text": "One major challenge encompassed in ALFWorld is commonsense reasoning. The agent needs to extract patterns from the few-shot examples provided and combine them with the agent’s general knowledge of household environments to fully understand task rules. More often than not, the as- sistant tends to neglect some basic knowledge of the household environment. Thanks to the easy-to- implement multi-agent conversational feature of  AutoGen , enhancing the assistant agent’s reason- ing ability by adding a new grounding agent to provide commonsense facts for the decision-making agent’s reference becomes straightforward. By scrutinizing the failed attempts and summarizing the reasons for failure, we obtained a holistic understanding of the commonsense knowledge that the assistant agent lacks. Then, we set a grounding agent to provide this general knowledge when the task begins and whenever the assistant outputs the same action three times in a row. This ensures the assistant takes this commonsense knowledge into consideration and prevents it from getting stuck in outputting the same content or constantly apologizing.",

We evaluated both systems based on 10 randomly selected questions, measuring time and accuracy. While both sys- tems answered 8 questions correctly, the Code Interpreter was significantly slower than OptiGuide because the former requires more manual intervention. On average, users needed to spend 4 minutes and 35 seconds to solve problems with the Code Interpreter, with a standard deviation of approxi- mately 2.5 minutes.

An example task is “How much money would I earn if I bought 200 $AAPL stocks at the lowest price in the last 30 days and sold them at the highest price? Save the results into a file.”  The four-agent group chat system comprised the following group members: a user proxy to take human inputs, an engineer to write code and fix bugs, a critic to review code and provide feedback, and a code executor for executing code. One of the possible alternatives is a two-agent system involving an LLM-based assistant and a user proxy agent, and another alternative is a group chat system with the same group members but a task-based speaker selection policy. In the task-based speaker selection policy, we simply ap- pend role information, chat history, and the next speaker’s task into a single prompt. Through the pilot study, we observed that compared with a task-style prompt, utilizing a role-play prompt in dy- namic speaker selection often leads to more effective consideration of both conversation context and role alignment during the process of generating the subsequent speaker, and consequently a higher success rate as reported in Table 5, fewer LLM calls and fewer termination failures, as reported in Table 6.",

This setup fosters social interaction and allows players to express their moves creatively, employing jokes, meme references, and character-playing, thereby making chess games more entertaining for both players and observers (Figure 15 provides an example of conversational chess).",

    "text": "To realize these scenarios, we constructed a player agent with LLM and human as back-end options. When human input is enabled, before sending the input to the board agent, it first prompts the human player to input the message that contains the move along with anything else the player wants to say (such as a witty comment). If human input is skipped or disabled, LLM is used to generate the message. The board agent is implemented with a custom reply function, which employs an LLM to parse the natural language input into a legal move in a structured format (e.g., UCI), and then pushes the move to the board. If the move is not legitimate, the board agent will reply with an error. Subsequently, the player agent needs to resend a message to the board agent until a legal move is made. Once the move is successfully pushed, the player agent sends the message to the opponent. As shown in Figure 15, the conversation between AI players can be natural and entertaining. When the player agent uses LLM to generate a message, it utilizes the board state and the error message from the board agent. This helps reduce the chance of hallucinating an invalid move. The chat between one player agent and the board agent is invisible to the other player agent, which helps keep the messages used in chat completion well-managed.",

    "text": "There are two notable benefits of using  AutoGen  to implement Conversational Chess. Firstly, the agent design in  AutoGen  facilitates the natural creation of objects and their interactions needed in our chess game. This makes development easy and intuitive. For example, the isolation of chat messages simplifies the process of making a proper LLM chat completion inference call. Secondly, AutoGen  greatly simplifies the implementation of agent behaviors using composition. Specifically, we utilized the  register reply  method supported by  AutoGen  agents to instantiate player agents and a board agent with custom reply functions. Concentrating the extension work needed at a single point (the reply function) simplifies the reasoning processes, and development and maintenance effort.",

With the multi-agent conversational framework in  AutoGen , it becomes easy to de- compose the automatic agent-environment interactions and the development of a decision-making agent by constructing an  executor  agent responsible for handling the interaction with the environ- ment, thereby delegating the decision-making part to other agents. Such a decomposition allows developers to reuse the decision-making agent for new tasks with minimal effort rather than build- ing a specialized decision-making agent for every new environment.",

MiniWoB++ comprises browser in- teraction tasks that involve utilizing mouse and keyboard actions to interact with browsers. The ultimate objective of each task is to complete the tasks described concisely in natural language, such as “expand the web section below and click the submit button.” Solving these tasks typically requires a sequence of web manipulation actions rather than a single action, and making action decisions at each time step requires access to the web status (in the form of HTML code) online. For the example above, clicking the submit button requires checking the web status after expanding the web section. We designed a straightforward two-agent system named MiniWobChat using  AutoGen , as shown in Figure 17. The assistant agent is an instance of the built-in  AssistantAgent  and is responsible for making action decisions for the given task. The second agent, the executor agent, is a customized UserProxyAgent , which is responsible for interacting with the benchmark by executing the actions suggested by the  AssistantAgent  and returning feedback.",

In our evaluation, we use all available tasks in the official RCI code, with varying degrees of difficulty, to conduct a comprehensive analysis against MiniWobChat. Figure 18 illustrates that MiniWobChat achieves competitive performance in this evaluation 8 . Specifically, among the 49 available tasks, MiniWobChat achieves a success rate of 52 . 8% , which is only  3 . 6%  lower than RCI, a method specifically designed for the MiniWob++ benchmark. It is worth noting that in most tasks, the difference between the two methods is mirrored as shown in Figure 18. If we consider 0.1 as a success rate tolerance for each task, i.e., two methods that differ within 0.1 are considered to have the same performance, both methods outperform the",

Auto- GPT faces challenges in handling tasks that involve complex rules due to its limited extensibility. It provides an interface for setting task goals using natural language. However, when dealing with the MiniWob++ benchmark, accurately instructing Auto-GPT to follow the instructions for using MiniWob++ proves challenging. There is no clear path to extend it in the manner of the two-agent chat facilitated by  AutoGen .",

The built-in  AssistantAgent  was directly reusable and exhibited strong performance without cus- tomization. Moreover, the decoupling of the execution and assistant agent ensures that modifications to one component do not adversely impact the other. This convenience simplifies maintenance and future updates.",
