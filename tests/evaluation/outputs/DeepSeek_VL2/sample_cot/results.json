      "text": "Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models\n\nJason Wei Xuezhi Wang Dale Schuurmans Maarten Bosma Brian Ichter Fei Xia Ed H. Chi Quoc V. Le Denny Zhou Google Research, Brain Team {jasonwei,dennyzhou}@google.com\n\nAbstract\n\nWe explore how generating a chain of thought—a series of intermediate reasoning steps—significantly improves the ability of large language models to perform complex reasoning. In particular, we show how such reasoning abilities emerge naturally in sufficiently large language models via a simple method called chain-of-thought prompting, where a few chain of thought demonstrations are provided as exemplars in prompting.\n\nExperiments on three large language models show that chain-of-thought prompting improves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks. The empirical gains can be striking. For instance, prompting a PaLM 540B with just eight chain-of-thought exemplars achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems, surpassing even finetuned GPT-3 with a verifier.\n\nFigure 1: Chain-of-thought prompting enables large language models to tackle complex arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks. Chain-of-thought reasoning processes are highlighted.",
