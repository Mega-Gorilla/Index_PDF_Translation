In particular, we show how such reasoning abilities emerge naturally in sufficiently large language models via a simple method called  chain-of- thought prompting , where a few chain of thought demonstrations are provided as exemplars in prompting.",

They used  20 to make lunch. So they had 23 - 20 = 3. They  bought 6 more apples, so they have 3 + 6 = 9. The  answer is 9.",
