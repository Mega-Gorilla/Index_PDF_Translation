Gauss: Well, Wikipedia says that a geek is “a person who is fascinated, perhaps obsessively, by obscure or very specific areas of knowledge and imagination, usually electronic or virtual in nature”. Curie: And how do they think you are a geek? Gauss: Well, have you ever seen this picture? Curie: Awww! Gauss: That’s right! I invented the commercial telegraph in 1833, and I used it to send the first message on the first commercial telegraph line between Hamburg and Cuxhaven in Germany. Curie: Wow! The first telegraph! And what did you send? Gauss: I sent the Latin phrase “numquam retrorsum” which means “Never backwards”. Curie: I see. . . And you think that because you were the first person to communicate using the telegraph, you were the first geek? Gauss: Well, the word “geek” doesn’t seem to have existed back then, so no. But I think that the telegraph can be considered an early form of social media. Curie: You mean, like Facebook or Twitter? Gauss: Yes, exactly! And I was the first person to use it! Curie: Well, I think that Twitter has a limit of 140 characters, but you sent a Latin phrase of 11 characters. Gauss: That’s right. I managed to do more with less. Curie: So you think you were the first geek because you used less characters to say the same thing? Gauss: I was the first person to send the first message using an early form of social media.
