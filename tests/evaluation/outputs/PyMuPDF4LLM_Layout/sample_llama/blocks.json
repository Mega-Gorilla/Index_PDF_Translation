In particular, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 (175B) on most benchmarks, and LLaMA- 65B is competitive with the best models, Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B.

These few-shot properties first appeared when scaling models to a sufficient size (Kaplan et al., 2020), resulting in a line of work that focuses on further scaling these models (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021). These efforts are based on the assumption that more parameters will lead to better performance. However, recent work from Hoffmann et al.

We believe that this model will help democratize the access and study of LLMs, since it can be run on a single GPU.
