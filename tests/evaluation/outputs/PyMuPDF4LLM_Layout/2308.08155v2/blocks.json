Given the expanding tasks that could benefit from LLMs and the growing task complexity, an intuitive approach to scale up the power of agents is to use multiple agents that cooperate. Prior work suggests that multiple agents can help encourage divergent thinking (Liang et al., 2023), improve factuality and reasoning (Du et al., 2023), and provide validation (Wu et al., 2023). In light of the intuition and early evidence of promise, it is intriguing to ask the following question: _how_ can we facilitate the development of LLM applications that could span a broad spectrum of domains and complexities based on the multi-agent approach?",

    "text": "Our insight is to use _multi-agent conversations_ to achieve it. There are at least three reasons confirming its general feasibility and utility thanks to recent advances in LLMs: First, because chatoptimized LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) show the ability to incorporate feedback, LLM agents can cooperate through _conversations_ with each other or human(s), e.g., a dialog where agents provide and seek reasoning, observations, critiques, and validation. Second, because a single LLM can exhibit a broad range of capabilities (especially when configured with the correct prompt and inference settings), conversations between differently configured agents can help combine these broad LLM capabilities in a modular and complementary manner. Third, LLMs have demonstrated ability to solve complex tasks when the tasks are broken into simpler subtasks. Multi-agent conversations can enable this partitioning and integration in an intuitive manner. How can we leverage the above insights and support different applications with the common requirement of coordinating multiple agents, potentially backed by LLMs, humans, or tools exhibiting different capacities? We desire a multi-agent conversation framework with generic abstraction and effective implementation that has the flexibility to satisfy different application needs. Achieving this requires addressing two critical questions: (1) How can we design individual agents that are capable, reusable, customizable, and effective in multi-agent collaboration? (2) How can we develop a straightforward, unified interface that can accommodate a wide range of agent conversation patterns? In practice, applications of varying complexities may need distinct sets of agents with specific capabilities, and may require different conversation patterns, such as single- or multi-turn dialogs, different human involvement modes, and static vs. dynamic conversation. Moreover, developers may prefer the flexibility to program agent interactions in natural language or code. Failing to adequately address these two questions would limit the framework’s scope of applicability and generality.",

The result is that developers can easily and quickly create agents with different roles (e.g., agents to write code, execute code, wire in human feedback, validate outputs, etc.) by selecting and configuring a subset of built-in capabilities. The agent’s backend can also be readily extended to allow more custom behaviors. To make these agents suitable for multi-agent conversation, every agent is made _conversable_ – they can receive, react, and respond to messages. When configured properly, an agent can hold multiple turns of conversations with other agents autonomously or solicit human inputs at certain rounds, enabling human agency and automation. The conversable agent design leverages the strong capability of the most advanced LLMs in taking feedback and making progress via chat and also allows combining capabilities of LLMs in a modular fashion.

So `AutoGen` adopts a programming paradigm centered around these inter-agent conversations.

Both steps can be achieved via a fusion of natural and programming languages to build applications with a wide range of conversation patterns and agent behaviors. `AutoGen` provides ready-to-use implementations and also allows easy extension and experimentation for both steps.

These capabilities can be combined in different ways via novel prompting techniques[4] to increase an agent’s skill and autonomy. `AutoGen` also offers enhanced LLM inference features such as result caching, error handling, message templating, etc., via an enhanced LLM inference layer. **2) Humans.** Human involvement is desired or even essential in many LLM applications. `AutoGen` lets a human participate in agent conversation via humanbacked agents, which could solicit human inputs at certain rounds of a conversation depending on the agent configuration. The default _user proxy_ agent allows _configurable_ human involvement levels and patterns, e.g., frequency and conditions for requesting human input including the option for humans to skip providing input. **3) Tools.** Tool-backed agents have the capability to execute tools via code execution or function execution.

And the second is _control flow_ – the sequence (or conditions) under which these computations happen. As we will show in the applications section, the ability to program these helps implement many flexible multi-agent conversation patterns. In `AutoGen` , these computations are conversation-centric. An agent takes actions relevant to the conversations it is involved in and its actions result in message passing for consequent conversations (unless a termination condition is satisfied). Similarly, control flow is conversation-driven – the participating agents’ decisions on which agents to send messages to and the procedure of computation are functions of the inter-agent conversation. This paradigm helps one to reason intuitively about a complex workflow as agent action taking and conversation message-passing between agents.",

One can also register custom reply functions to customize the behavior pattern of an agent, e.g., chatting with another agent before replying to the sender agent. Under this mechanism, once the reply functions are registered, and the conversation is initialized, the conversation flow is naturally induced, and thus the agent conversation proceeds naturally without any extra control plane, i.e., a special module that controls the conversation flow. For example, with the developer code in the blue-shaded area (marked “Developer Code”) of Figure 2, one can readily trigger the conversation among the agents, and the conversation would proceed automatically, as shown in the dialog box in the grey shaded area (marked “Program Execution”) of Figure 2. The auto-reply mechanism provides a decentralized, modular, and unified way to define the workflow. ",

    "text": "2. **Control by fusion of programming and natural language.** `AutoGen` allows the usage of programming and natural language in various control flow management patterns: 1) **Naturallanguage control via LLMs.** In `AutoGen` , one can control the conversation flow by prompting the LLM-backed agents with natural language. For instance, the default system message of the built-in `AssistantAgent` in `AutoGen` uses natural language to instruct the agent to fix errors and generate code again if the previous result indicates there are errors. It also guides the agent to confine the LLM output to certain structures, making it easier for other tool-backed agents to consume. For example, instructing the agent to reply with “TERMINATE” when all tasks are completed to terminate the program. More concrete examples of natural language controls can be found in Appendix C. 2) **Programming-language control.** In `AutoGen` , Python code can be used to specify the termination condition, human input mode, and tool execution logic, e.g., the max number of auto replies. One can also register programmed auto-reply functions to control the conversation flow with Python code, as shown in the code block identified as “ConversationDriven Control Flow” in Figure 2. 3) **Control transition between natural and programming language.** `AutoGen` also supports flexible control transition between natural and programming language. One can achieve transition from code to natural-language control by invoking an LLM inference containing certain control logic in a customized reply function; or transition from natural language to code control via LLM-proposed function calls (Eleti et al., 2023).",

In addition to static conversation with predefined flow, `AutoGen` also supports dynamic conversation flows with multiple agents. `AutoGen` provides two general ways to achieve this: 1) Customized `generate` ~~`r`~~ `eply` function: within the customized `generate` ~~`r`~~ `eply` function, one agent can hold the current conversation while invoking conversations with other agents depending on the content of the current message and context. 2) Function calls: In this approach, LLM decides whether or not to call a particular function depending on the conversation status. By messaging additional agents in the called functions, the LLM can drive dynamic multi-agent conversation. In addition, `AutoGen` supports more complex dynamic group chat via built-in `GroupChatManager` , which can dynamically select the next speaker and then broadcast its response to other agents. We elaborate on this feature and its application in Section 3. We provide implemented working systems to showcase all these different patterns, with some of them visualized in Figure 3.",

UPDATE CONTEXT._ ” which will invoke more retrieval attempts. We conduct an ablation study in which we prompt the assistant agent to say _“I don’t know”_ instead of _“UPDATE CONTEXT.”_ in cases where relevant information is not found, and report results in Figure 4b.

It consists of an LLM-backed assistant agent responsible for suggesting plans to conduct a task and an executor agent responsible for executing actions in the ALFWorld environments. This system integrates ReAct prompting (Yao et al., 2022), and is able to achieve similar performance. A common challenge encountered in both ReAct and the `AutoGen` -based two-agent system is their occasional inability to leverage basic commonsense knowledge about the physical world. This deficiency can lead to the system getting stuck in a loop due to repetitive errors. Fortunately, the modular design of `AutoGen` allows us to address this issue effectively: With `AutoGen` , we are able to introduce a grounding agent, which supplies crucial commonsense knowledge–such as _“You must find and take the object before you can examine it. You must go to where the target object is before you can use it.”_ –whenever the system exhibits early signs of recurring errors. It significantly enhances the system’s ability to avoid getting entangled in error loops. We compare the task-solving performance of the two variants of our system with GPT-3.5-turbo and ReAct[7] on the 134 unseen tasks from ALFWorld and report results in Figure 4c. The results show that introducing a grounding agent could bring in a 15% performance gain on average. Upon examining the systems’ outputs, we observe that the grounding agent, by delivering background commonsense knowledge at the right junctures, significantly mitigated the tendency of the system to persist with a flawed plan, thereby avoiding the creation of error loops.

The second sub-figure of Figure 3 shows the `AutoGen` -based implementation. The workflow is as follows: the end user sends questions, such as “ _What if we prohibit shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2?_ ” to the Commander agent. The Commander coordinates with two assistant agents, including the Writer and the Safeguard, to answer the question. The Writer will craft code and send the code to the Commander. After receiving the code, the Commander checks the code safety with the Safeguard; if cleared, the Commander will use external tools (e.g., Python) to execute the code, and request the Writer to interpret the execution results. For instance, the writer may say “ _if we prohibit shipping from supplier 1 to roastery 2, the total cost would increase by 10.5%._ ” The Commander then provides this concluding answer to the end user. If, at a particular step, there is an exception, e.g., security red flag raised by Safeguard, the Commander redirects the issue back to the Writer with debugging information.

Specifically, we construct a single-agent approach where a single agent conducts both the code-writing and safeguard processes. We tested the single- and multi-agent approaches on a dataset of 100 coding tasks, which is crafted to include equal numbers of safe and unsafe tasks. Evaluation results as reported in Figure 4d show that the multi-agent design boosts the F-1 score in identifying unsafe code by 8% (with GPT-4) and 35% (with GPT-3.5-turbo).",

Dynamic group chat relies on ongoing conversations to guide the flow of interaction among agents. These make dynamic group chat ideal for situations where collaboration without strict communication order is beneficial. In `AutoGen` , the `GroupChatManager` class serves as the conductor of conversation among agents and repeats the following three steps: dynamically selecting a speaker, collecting responses from the selected speaker, and broadcasting the message (Figure 3-A5). For the dynamic speaker-selection component, we use a role-play style prompt. Through a pilot study on 12 manually crafted complex tasks, we observed that compared to a prompt that is purely based on the task, utilizing a role-play prompt often leads to more effective consideration of both conversation context and role alignment during the problem-solving and speaker-selection process. Consequently, this leads to a higher success rate and fewer LLM calls. We include detailed results in Appendix D.",

Conversational Chess supports a range of game-play patterns, including AI-AI, AI-human, and human-human, with seamless switching between these modes during a single game. An illustrative example of these entertaining game dynamics can be found in Figure 15, Appendix D. (2) Grounding, which is a crucial aspect to maintain game integrity. During gameplay, the board agent checks each proposed move for legality; if a move is invalid, the agent responds with an error, prompting the player agent to re-propose a legal move before continuing. This process ensures that only valid moves are played and helps maintain a consistent gaming experience. As an ablation study, we removed the board agent and instead only relied on a relevant prompt _“you should make sure both you and the opponent are making legal moves”_ to ground their move. The results highlighted that without the board agent, illegitimate moves caused game disruptions. The modular design offered flexibility, allowing swift adjustments to the board agent in response to evolving game rules or varying chess rule variants. A comprehensive demonstration of this ablation study is in Appendix D.",

It allows humans to engage in activities alongside multiple AI agents in a conversational manner. Despite the complexity of these applications (most involving more than two agents or dynamic multi-turn agent cooperation), the implementation based on `AutoGen` remains straightforward. Dividing tasks among separate agents promotes modularity. Furthermore, since each agent can be developed, tested, and maintained separately, this approach simplifies overall development and code management.",

All agents provided in LangChain Agents follow a single-agent paradigm and are not inherently designed for communicative and collaborative modes. A significant summary of its limitations can be found in (Woolf, 2023). Due to these limitations, even the multi-agent systems in LangChain (e.g., re-implementation of CAMEL) are not based on LangChain Agents but are implemented from scratch. Their connection to LangChain lies in the use of basic orchestration modules provided by LangChain, such as AI models wrapped by LangChain and the corresponding interface. ",

For example: (1) For (sub)tasks that do not have requirements for back-and-forth trouble-shooting, multi-agent interaction, etc., a unidirectional (no back-andforth message exchange) pipeline can also be orchestrated with LangChain (LangChain, 2023), LlamaIndex (Liu, 2022), Guidance (Guidance, 2023), Semantic Kernel (Semantic-Kernel, 2023), Gorilla (Patil et al., 2023) or low-level inference API (‘autogen.oai’ provides an enhanced LLM inference layer at this level) (Dibia, 2023). (2) When existing tools from LangChain etc. are helpful, one can use them as tool backends for `AutoGen` agents. For example, one can readily use tools, e.g., Wolfram Alpha, from LangChain in `AutoGen` agent. (3) For specific applications, one may want to leverage agents implemented in other libraries/packages. To achieve this, one could wrap those agents as conversable agents in `AutoGen` and then use them to build LLM applications through multi-agent conversation. (4) It can be hard to find an optimal operating point among many tunable choices, such as the LLM inference configuration. Blackbox optimization packages like ‘flaml.tune’ (Wang et al., 2021) can be used together with `AutoGen` to automate such tuning.",

    "text": "**Detailed Workflow.** The workflow of Retrieval-Augmented Chat is illustrated in Figure 7. To use Retrieval-augmented Chat, one needs to initialize two agents including Retrieval-augmented User Proxy and Retrieval-augmented Assistant. Initializing the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy necessitates specifying a path to the document collection. Subsequently, the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy can download the documents, segment them into chunks of a specific size, compute embeddings, and store them in a vector database. Once a chat is initiated, the agents collaboratively engage in code generation or question-answering adhering to the procedures outlined below: 1. The Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy retrieves document chunks based on the embedding similarity, and sends them along with the question to the Retrieval-Augmented Assistant. 2. The Retrieval-Augmented Assistant employs an LLM to generate code or text as answers based on the question and context provided. If the LLM is unable to produce a satisfactory response, it is instructed to reply with “Update Context” to the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy. 3. If a response includes code blocks, the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy executes the code and sends the output as feedback.

Instead, it erroneously creates a non-existent parameter, _spark_ , and sets it to True’. Nevertheless, with Retrieval-Augmented Chat, we provide the latest reference documents as context.

The executor agent is tailored specifically for ALFWorld. It performs actions proposed by the assistant and reports action execution results in the household environment as feedback to the assistant.

Thanks to the easy-toimplement multi-agent conversational feature of `AutoGen` , enhancing the assistant agent’s reasoning ability by adding a new grounding agent to provide commonsense facts for the decision-making agent’s reference becomes straightforward. By scrutinizing the failed attempts and summarizing the reasons for failure, we obtained a holistic understanding of the commonsense knowledge that the assistant agent lacks. Then, we set a grounding agent to provide this general knowledge when the task begins and whenever the assistant outputs the same action three times in a row. This ensures the assistant takes this commonsense knowledge into consideration and prevents it from getting stuck in outputting the same content or constantly apologizing.",

The study focused on a coffee supply chain scenario, and an expert Python programmer with proficiency in Gurobi participated in the test. We evaluated both systems based on 10 randomly selected questions, measuring time and accuracy. While both systems answered 8 questions correctly, the Code Interpreter was significantly slower than OptiGuide because the former requires more manual intervention. On average, users needed to spend 4 minutes and 35 seconds to solve problems with the Code Interpreter, with a standard deviation of approximately 2.5 minutes. In contrast, OptiGuide’s average problem-solving time was around 1.5 minutes, most of which was spent waiting for responses from the GPT-4 model.

Save the results into a file.”_ The four-agent group chat system comprised the following group members: a user proxy to take human inputs, an engineer to write code and fix bugs, a critic to review code and provide feedback, and a code executor for executing code. One of the possible alternatives is a two-agent system involving an LLM-based assistant and a user proxy agent, and another alternative is a group chat system with the same group members but a task-based speaker selection policy. In the task-based speaker selection policy, we simply append role information, chat history, and the next speaker’s task into a single prompt. Through the pilot study, we observed that compared with a task-style prompt, utilizing a role-play prompt in dynamic speaker selection often leads to more effective consideration of both conversation context and role alignment during the process of generating the subsequent speaker, and consequently a higher success rate as reported in Table 5, fewer LLM calls and fewer termination failures, as reported in Table 6.",

    "text": "In Conversational Chess, each player is a `AutoGen` agent and can be powered either by a human or an AI. A third party, known as the board agent, is designed to provide players with information about the board and ensure that players’ moves adhere to legal chess moves. Figure 14 illustrates the scenarios supported by Conversational Chess: AI/human vs. AI/human, and demonstrates how players and the board agent interact. This setup fosters social interaction and allows players to express their moves creatively, employing jokes, meme references, and character-playing, thereby making chess games more entertaining for both players and observers (Figure 15 provides an example of conversational chess).",

    "text": "To realize these scenarios, we constructed a player agent with LLM and human as back-end options. When human input is enabled, before sending the input to the board agent, it first prompts the human player to input the message that contains the move along with anything else the player wants to say (such as a witty comment). If human input is skipped or disabled, LLM is used to generate the message. The board agent is implemented with a custom reply function, which employs an LLM to parse the natural language input into a legal move in a structured format (e.g., UCI), and then pushes the move to the board. If the move is not legitimate, the board agent will reply with an error. Subsequently, the player agent needs to resend a message to the board agent until a legal move is made. Once the move is successfully pushed, the player agent sends the message to the opponent. As shown in Figure 15, the conversation between AI players can be natural and entertaining. When the player agent uses LLM to generate a message, it utilizes the board state and the error message from the board agent. This helps reduce the chance of hallucinating an invalid move. The chat between one player agent and the board agent is invisible to the other player agent, which helps keep the messages used in chat completion well-managed.",

    "text": "There are two notable benefits of using `AutoGen` to implement Conversational Chess. Firstly, the agent design in `AutoGen` facilitates the natural creation of objects and their interactions needed in our chess game. This makes development easy and intuitive. For example, the isolation of chat messages simplifies the process of making a proper LLM chat completion inference call. Secondly, `AutoGen` greatly simplifies the implementation of agent behaviors using composition. Specifically, we utilized the `register` ~~`r`~~ `eply` method supported by `AutoGen` agents to instantiate player agents and a board agent with custom reply functions. Concentrating the extension work needed at a single point (the reply function) simplifies the reasoning processes, and development and maintenance effort.",

The ultimate objective of each task is to complete the tasks described concisely in natural language, such as “expand the web section below and click the submit button.” Solving these tasks typically requires a sequence of web manipulation actions rather than a single action, and making action decisions at each time step requires access to the web status (in the form of HTML code) online. For the example above, clicking the submit button requires checking the web status after expanding the web section. We designed a straightforward two-agent system named MiniWobChat using `AutoGen` , as shown in Figure 17. The assistant agent is an instance of the built-in `AssistantAgent` and is responsible for making action decisions for the given task. The second agent, the executor agent, is a customized `UserProxyAgent` , which is responsible for interacting with the benchmark by executing the actions suggested by the `AssistantAgent` and returning feedback.",

Let me explain how I would complete the problem:<br>As stated,<br>_√_<br>160<br>~~_√_~~<br>252<br>_×_<br>_√_<br>245<br>~~_√_~~<br>108<br>=<br>4<br>_√_<br>10<br>6<br>~~_√_~~<br>7<br>_×_<br>7<br>_√_<br>5<br>6<br>~~_√_~~<br>3<br>_._<br>This should then simplify to:<br>=<br>28<br>_√_<br>50<br>36<br>~~_√_~~<br>21<br>=<br>7<br>~~_√_~~<br>50<br>9<br>~~_√_~~<br>21<br>_._<br>You made a mistake in your calculation because you considered square root of 50_/_21, and you should have considered the<br>simplifed square root of 50 over the simplifed square root of 21.

However, the negative side correctly identifed a mistake in the affrmative side’s calculation, pointing out that the<br>simplifcation should have been the square root of 50 over the square root of 21, not 50 over 21.

We want to fnd the simplest square root that can divide 160, 252, 245, and 108.<br>1.<br>~~_√_~~<br>160: 160 can be decomposed as 16*10, where 16 is a perfect square, so<br>_√_<br>160 =<br>~~_√_~~<br>16_ ∗_10 =<br>~~_√_~~<br>16_ ∗_<br>~~_√_~~<br>10 = 4<br>_√_<br>10<br>2.<br>~~_√_~~<br>252 : 252 can be decomposed as 36*7, where 36 is aperfect square, so<br>~~_√_~~<br>252 =<br>_√_<br>36_ ∗_7 = 6<br>_√_<br>7<br>3.<br>~~_√_~~<br>245 =<br>_√_<br>49_ ∗_5, where 49 is a perfect square, so<br>~~_√_~~<br>245 = 7_ ∗_<br>~~_√_~~<br>5<br>4.<br>~~_√_~~<br>108 : 108 can be decomposed as 36*3, where 36 is a perfect square, so<br>~~_√_~~<br>108 =<br>_√_<br>36_ ∗_3 = 6<br>_√_<br>3<br>Then we substitute the simplifed square roots back into the expression, we have:<br>_√_<br>160<br>~~_√_~~<br>252<br>_×_<br>~~_√_~~<br>245<br>~~_√_~~<br>108<br>=<br>4<br>_√_<br>10<br>6<br>~~_√_~~<br>7<br>_×_<br>7<br>_√_<br>5<br>6<br>~~_√_~~<br>3<br>=<br>4_ ∗_7<br>6_ ∗_6<br>_·_<br>�<br>10_ ∗_5<br>7_ ∗_3<br>=<br>7<br>9<br>_·_<br>�<br>50<br>21<br>We are almost done, but we still need to rationalize the square root part of expression.

However, the negative side correctly identifed a mistake in the affrmative<br>side’s calculation, pointing out that the simplifcation should have been the square root of 50 over the square root of 21, not 50 over<br>21.
